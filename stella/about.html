						<p>Oh sure! Blame the wizards! You wouldn't. Ask anyway! I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet. I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! No, she'll probably make me do it.</p>

						<li>Robot 1-X, save my friends!  And Zoidberg!</li>
						<li>And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it.</li>

						<p>Bender, we're trying our best. No, I'm Santa Claus! No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Oh yeah, good luck with that.</p>

						<p>Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Daddy Bender, we're hungry. It must be wonderful.</p>
						<p>A true inspiration for the children. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. Yes! In your face, Gandhi!</p>
						<p>Is that a cooking show? Your best is an idiot! This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?</p>
						<p>Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very&hellip; And I'm his friend Jesus. Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Ooh, name it after me!</p>

						<p>With gusto. Actually, that's still true. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. How much did you make me?</p>
						<p>WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Is that a cooking show? Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.</p>
						<p>Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? File not found. She also liked to shut up!</p>
